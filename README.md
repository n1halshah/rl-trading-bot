# Deep Q-Learning Trading Agent

A reinforcement learning agent that learns to trade a single stock (AAPL) using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**.  
The agent observes market features (price, momentum, position) and chooses actions (buy, sell, hold) to maximize profit.

## ðŸš€ Motivation
Apply reinforcement learning to algorithmic trading, enabling the agent to learn and adapt to market conditions.

Strengthen C++ skills by implementing a neural network and Deep Q-Learning from scratch.

Gain a deep understanding of RL internals, including forward/backward passes, Q-value updates, and reward shaping.

Explore AI/ML applications in financial markets through hands-on, practical experimentation.
